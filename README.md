# bingojs

I think I wrote this originally in 2002 when a friend who ran Binjo wanted an app he could project from his laptop. So I whiped something up in JS he could run from his latop without a Internet connection that would look decent projected. I'm sure the code could be updated but it still runs fine.

All the code and images are in the client.
